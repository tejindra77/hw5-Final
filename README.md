## Description
This project implements a simplified version of the Scrabble game using jQuery UI for drag-and-drop functionality. The game allows a user to drag letter tiles from a rack onto a single row of the Scrabble board and calculates the score based on the letters and bonus squares. Additionally, the game validates the formed word using a dictionary.

## Implemented Features
1. Draggable Tiles: Each letter tile on the rack is a draggable image that the user can drag onto the Scrabble board.
2. Droppable Board Squares: Each square on the Scrabble board is a droppable target that accepts letter tiles.
3. Tile Rack Initialization: The rack is populated with 7 random tiles from the tile distribution.
4. Score Calculation: The score is calculated based on the values of the letters and any bonus squares they occupy.
5. Word Completion: A button allows the user to indicate that they have completed forming a word, at which point the score is calculated.
6. Word Validation: The formed word is validated against a dictionary to ensure it is a valid word.
